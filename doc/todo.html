</br><br><h1>Terrier Future Features and Known Issues</h1>
<p>List of features and known issues that are marked for future Terrier versions:<br/>
<h2>Future Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>New types of indices. In Terrier 4.0, the central <a href="javadoc/org/terrier/structures/Index.html">Index</a> class will become abstract and will be extended by different types of index. Current index functionality will move to new type of index called IndexOnDisk.</li>
<li>The structures within an index will become more generic. In Terrier 4.0, Inverted and Direct indices will become <a href="javadoc/org/terrier/structures/PostingIndex.html">PostingIndex</a> instances instead of being separate classes like <a href="javadoc/org/terrier/structures/InvertedIndex.html">InvertedIndex</a>. New code should use PostingIndex where possible.</li>
<li>New index types that can be updated incrementally will be added In Terrier 4.0. These will allow new documents to be added on-the-fly for real-time search applications.</li>
<li>Functionality to create memory-only indices that can be incrementally updated over time.</li>
<li>Functionality to create, modify and search over groups of separate indices as if they were one index.</li>    
<li>Improved Learning-to-Rank support with result sets that can hold document feature information.</li>
<li>Move towards a modular sub-package structure to facilitate the release of non-core functionalities.</li> 
<li>The addition of Terrier's own Exceptions for setup, indexing, querying.</li>
</ul> 
<h2>Known Issues</h2>
<ul>
<li>Query language should be refined: In particular, ambiguity warnings when generating the parser with ANTLR should be removed, and a more structured query language should be introduced.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Deprecations, Scheduled Refactorings</h2>
<p>The following classes and interfaces are/may be deprecated in this version of Terrier and will likely be removed or refactored in a future release:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="javadoc/org/terrier/indexing/Indexer.html">Indexer</a> and <a href="javadoc/org/terrier/structures/indexing">org.terrier.structures.indexing</a> hierarchy may be refactored in a future release.</li>
<li><a href="javadoc/org/terrier/utility/ApplicationSetup.html">ApplicationSetup</a> will be replaced with a new non-global configuration API.</li>
<li>The five field weighting model score() methods are being deprecated since only the two field versions are used.
<li>Terrier currently uses Hadoop version 0.20. Future releases of Terrier will upgrade to a later branch. Instructions to upgrade Terrier yourself can be found <a href="http://ir.dcs.gla.ac.uk/wiki/Terrier/UpgradingHadoop">here</a></li> 
</ul>
